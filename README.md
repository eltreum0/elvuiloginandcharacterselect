# ElvUI Login Screen and Character Select

Glues and Buttons to update the Login Screen and Character Select to the ElvUI Style, these files were updated by Eltreum and include files from ODDBALL250's version

## Installation

Choose between Red, Blue and Grey versions, then choose between Regular/Opaque and Transparent buttons.

Folder structure is as follows:

Blue
	> Regular
		>Folders you need to extract
	> Transparent
		>Folders you need to extract
	
Red
	> Regular
		>Folders you need to extract
	> Transparent
		>Folders you need to extract
			
Grey
	> Regular
		>Folders you need to extract
	> Transparent
		>Folders you need to extract

This means extract the following folders:
	* Buttons
	* CharacterCreate
	* CHATFRAME
	* COMMON
	* DialogFrame
	* FrameGeneral
	* friendsframe
	* Glues
	* HELPFRAME
	* Interface
	* MacroFrame
	* optionsframe
	* PaperDollInfoFrame
	* STORE
	* Tooltips
	* Vehicles

Into `World of Warcraft\_retail_\Interface\`

##Classic Fix:
	For Classic the highlight is used differently and it will break out of bounds on some buttons. The glues work for the most part and if you wish to use them extract the folders inside Classic Fix after choosing a version from above.
	This means open the classic fix folder and extract the Glues folder inside of it into your Interface folder as you did above, but overwrite the contents with the file from Classic Fix.


## WARNING
Failure to extract these folders into your Interface folder will result in this glue and button replacement not working.

*You will also need to reboot the game to load the new files*
