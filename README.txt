##About Classic and TBC:
	Due to the way blizzard uses the highlights some places will have mismatching sizes since the files are used on more than one place, this happens on the default UI as well but its more hidden due to its appereance.
	Classic will have different coloring despite using the same files due to the way the engine handles the glues


## WARNING
Failure to extract these folders into your Interface folder will result in this glue and button replacement not working.

*You will also need to reboot the game to load the new files*
